‚ö° Core Projects
üöÄ RISC-V Pipelined Processor
Pipelined a single-cycle RISC-V processor into a 5-stage pipeline: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback.

Implemented an RV32I ISA in Verilog with arithmetic, logic, control, and memory operations.

Utilized ImmGen, ALU, and advanced forwarding and bypassing techniques to resolve data hazards; validated using waveform analysis.

üî¢ FPGA-based Approximate Multiplier
Developed an 8-bit Verilog multiplier with LSB truncation to optimize power and logic complexity.

Compared exact vs. approximate outputs, calculated percent error, and flagged deviations.

Verified with testbench; displayed output on a 7-segment display using Vivado on Nexys 4 (Artix-7).

Simulated functionality and synthesized design in Vivado, confirming reduced hardware utilization.

ü§ñ Bare-metal UART & Virtual Memory OS
Developed a bare-metal UART driver for a Raspberry Pi 2 in ARMv7-A AArch32 using assembly/C.

Designed a 2-level page table (4KB) for virtual memory using ARM MMU, isolating kernel (0x8000+) and user (0x100000+) spaces.

Restricted MMIO access (UART0 at 0x3F201000) to the kernel-only via MMU protection.

Implemented a syscall interface using SVC for EL0-to-EL1 UART output via printf().

Supported user program loading at 0x100000 with MMU-based access control and debug trapping.

üöó IoT Smart Parking System
Built a real-time sensor-based slot detection system using Ultrasonic sensors, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi.

Coded in Python to process data and push updates to a live dashboard.

Supported modular multi-lot design for scalable smart city integration.
