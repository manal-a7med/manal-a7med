### About Me

I am an undergraduate Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a strong interest in embedded systems, digital hardware design, and system-level architecture. My academic work and projects span areas like RISC-V processor customization, low-power digital circuit optimization, cryptographic hardware acceleration, and FPGA-based real-time systems.

Currently, I am focused on:

- FPGA-based smart hardware systems (traffic controllers, image filters)
- Bare-metal embedded programming on ARM-based boards
- Designing and simulating custom logic using Verilog on Artix-7
- Exploring the intersection of hardware efficiency and algorithmic design
